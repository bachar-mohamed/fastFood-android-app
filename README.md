# About the project

I developed this project to create an Android app that allows users to browse different fast food options and add them to a cart. The app offers four main categories: pizzas, burgers, tacos, and salads, so users can easily find what they’re craving.

While I haven’t added the ability to make purchases yet, I’ve built a solid system for navigating and managing items. I focused on keeping the design simple and easy to use, so anyone can navigate the app without any hassle.
My goal with this project was to practice and apply what I have learned about android development, this as a starting point, and more updates will be added in the future like like adding payment options.

Bellow is an overview of the functionalities offered by the application.

### 1. Home Page
The home page features the categories of products available which are divided into 4 categories:**pizza, Burger, tacos,and salad**.
Within each category, a selection of food items is displayed,each with some basic information like ingredients, price and rating to help users quickly identify their choices.

the user also have the option to search for a specific item, with the search limited to the currently selected category.
